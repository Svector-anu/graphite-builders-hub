## ⚙️ How to Use This Repo

### ✅ 1. Clone and Run Immediately

This is the fastest way to get started.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Svector-anu/graphite-builders-hub
cd graphite-builders-hub
npm install
cp .env.example .env
````

Update `.env` with your Graphite config:

```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
GRAPHITE_NODE_URL=https://anon-entrypoint-1.atgraphite.com
GRAPHITE_API_URL=https://api.main.atgraphite.com/api
```

Then run:

```bash
node examples/lending-app.js         # ✅ Lending demo
node examples/marketplace-app.js     # ✅ Marketplace demo
```

---

### 💡 2. Build From Scratch & Learn

Prefer to **start your own custom project**?

```bash
mkdir my-graphite-app
cd my-graphite-app
npm init -y
npm install web3 dotenv @atgraphite/web3-plugin
```

Then:

* Create a `GraphiteClient.js` using the one in this repo
* Add your own example like `lending-app.js` or `marketplace-app.js`
* Build your trust-based features from there

> Ideal for: learners, builders, teams starting their own dApps using Graphite trust infrastructure

---

## 📚 Learning Goals

✅ Understand how to initialize and use the Graphite Web3 plugin
✅ Learn how trust scores and KYC levels affect lending or listings
✅ Know how to build Graphite-compatible apps with confidence
✅ Extend or fork this repo for your own Graphite-powered apps
