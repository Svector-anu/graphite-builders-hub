##  What is Graphite Builders Hub?

Graphite Builders Hub is your gateway to building decentralized applications with built-in trust and reputation systems. Instead of treating all users equally, your dApps can make intelligent decisions based on verified identity and trust scores.

**What makes this special?**
-  **Trust-First Architecture**: Build dApps that know who they're dealing with
-  **KYC Integration**: Seamless identity verification without sacrificing decentralization  
-  **Reputation Systems**: Leverage trust scores for better user experiences
-  **Ready-to-Use**: Pre-built examples and utilities to get you started immediately

##  Who is this for?

- **New blockchain developers** looking to build more sophisticated dApps
- **Hackathon builders** who want to stand out with trust-based features
- **Development teams** exploring KYC and compliance use cases
- **Web3 developers** familiar with ethers.js, viem, or Web3.js who want to level up

### Core Components

- **`GraphiteClient.js`**: A reusable client powered by Web3.js and @atgraphite/web3-plugin
- **Lending App Example**: Demonstrates trust-based loan approvals and risk assessment
- **Marketplace App Example**: Shows seller verification with dynamic trust scores
- **Environment Setup**: Pre-configured with Graphite RPC and API endpoints

##  Quick Start

### Option 1: Clone and Run (Recommended for Learning)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/graphite-builders-hub.git
cd graphite-builders-hub

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys (instructions included in file)

# Run the lending app example
node examples/lending-app.js

# Run the marketplace app example  
node examples/marketplace-app.js
```

### Option 2: Build From Scratch (For New Projects)

```bash
# Create your new project
mkdir my-graphite-dapp
cd my-graphite-dapp

# Initialize npm project
npm init -y

# Install required dependencies
npm install web3 @atgraphite/web3-plugin dotenv

# Copy the GraphiteClient (you can download this file from our repo)
curl -o GraphiteClient.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-org/graphite-builders-hub/main/src/GraphiteClient.js

# Create your environment file
curl -o .env.example https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-org/graphite-builders-hub/main/.env.example
cp .env
```

## üîß Environment Setup

Your `.env` file should include:

```env
# # Wallet configuration
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# Graphite network endpoints
GRAPHITE_NODE_URL=https://anon-entrypoint-1.atgraphite.com
GRAPHITE_API_URL=https://api.main.atgraphite.com/api


# Optional: Custom contract addresses
LENDING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...
MARKETPLACE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...
```

##  Learning Examples

### 1. Trust-Based Lending App

```javascript
// Run: node examples/lending-app.js
const graphite = new GraphiteClient();

// Check borrower's trust score before approving loan
const borrower = await graphite.getUser('0x...');
if (borrower.trustScore > 750) {
    // Approve loan with favorable terms
    console.log('‚úÖ Loan approved - high trust score');
} else {
    // Request additional collateral or deny
    console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è Additional verification required');
}
```

### 2. Marketplace with Seller Verification

```javascript  
// Run: node examples/marketplace-app.js
const graphite = new GraphiteClient();

// Verify seller before listing expensive items
const seller = await graphite.getUser('0x...');
const isVerified = await graphite.isKYCVerified(seller.address);

if (isVerified && seller.trustScore > 600) {
    console.log('‚úÖ Verified seller - can list high-value items');
} else {
    console.log('üìù Basic seller - limited to small transactions');
}
```

##  Learning Goals

By working through this starter kit, you'll learn:
